To package the
module that was developed, navigate to the directory which contains the mods and src
directories. From within that directory, execute the following commands via the command line:
mkdir lib
jar --create --file=lib/org.firstModule@1.0.jar --module-version=1.0 --main-class=org.
firstModule.Main -C mods/org.firstModule .
This utility will package the module into a JAR file within the lib directory. The JAR file can then be
executed with the java executable as follows:
java -p lib -m org.firstModule
